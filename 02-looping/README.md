# Looping

This folder contains programs demonstrating iterative logic using:

- for loops
- while loops
- nested loops

## Learning Objectives

- Generate numeric patterns
- Perform repeated calculations
- Implement factorial and series logic
- Build nested pattern programs

## Example Compilation

```bash
gcc factorial_iterative_recursive.c -o factorial
./factorial
```

## Concepts Practiced
- Iteration control
- Loop boundaries
- Pattern generation
- Basic algorithm comparison (iterative vs recursive)
