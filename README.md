# C Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains structured exercises and implementations covering the core concepts of C programming.

## Covered Topics

- Control Flow (if-else, switch)
- Looping (for, while, do-while)
- Functions (with and without return values)
- Arrays (1D, 2D, matrix operations)
- Strings (manual manipulation, comparison)
- Struct and data modeling

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate a strong foundation in procedural programming and problem-solving using C.
