# C Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains structured exercises and implementations covering the core concepts of C programming.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate a strong foundation in procedural programming and problem-solving using C.

## Folder Structure

- `01-control-flow/` → Decision making (if-else, switch)
- `02-looping/` → Iteration patterns and numeric logic
- `03-functions/` → Function modularity and parameter passing
- `04-arrays/` → 1D and 2D array operations
- `05-strings/` → Manual string manipulation
- `06-struct/` → Struct and structured data modeling

Each folder contains focused, single-responsibility programs intended to reinforce core concepts.

## Technical Focus

This repository emphasizes:

- Clean procedural design
- Modular function implementation
- Manual memory-level logic (especially for strings)
- Structured data modeling using struct
- Iterative and recursive algorithm comparison
- Defensive input handling

---

## Requirements

- GCC or compatible C compiler

---


## How to Compile

Basic compilation:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```
